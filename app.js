//Part 2: Practical Math
/*You are planning a cross-country road trip:
-The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
-Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
-At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
-At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
-At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
-You have a fuel budget of $175.
-The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
-Set up a program to answer the following questions:
-How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
-Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
-How long will the trip take, in hours? */

//- The total distance of the trip.
let totalDistance = 1500;
console.log(`The total distance of the trip is ${totalDistance} miles`);

//a- The total gallon of fuel needed for the entire trip are calculated as follows.
// @ 55 mph = 30 mpg: 
let at55Mph = 30;
let totalGallon;
totalGallon =  totalDistance/ at55Mph;
console.log(`The total gallon of fuel at 55 mph needed is ${totalGallon} gallons`);

// @ 60 mph = 28 mpg:
let at60Mph = 28;
totalGallon =  totalDistance/ at60Mph;
console.log(`The total gallon of fuel at 60 mph needed is ${totalGallon} gallons`);

// @ 75 mph = 23 mpg:
let at75Mph = 23;
totalGallon =  totalDistance/ at75Mph;
console.log(`The total gallon of fuel at 75 mph needed is ${totalGallon} gallons`);

//b- To know whether our budget is enough to cover the fuel cost, first we need to calculate the total fuel cost of the trip. 
let fuelCost = 175;
let fuelEfficiency = 3;
let totalFuelCost = fuelCost * fuelEfficiency;
console.log(`The total fuel cost of the trip is ${totalFuelCost} $`);
//Note: As the total fuel cost calculated is 525$, so our budget is not enough to cover the fuel cost and we need 350$ to cover .

//c- Calculate the total time of the trip.
let totalTime = totalDistance / totalFuelCost;
console.log(`The total time of the trip is ${totalTime} hours`);
//Note: As the total time calculated is 2.8 hours, so the trip will take 2.8 hours.
